### Capstone Project (2017)

This was a capstone project inteded for Notre Dame University - Cotabato City.

An undergraduate curriculum monitoring system made to speed up the process during enrollments and to guide students with their respective course curriculum.

Made using PHP CodeIgniter

We tried our best to do the best practices in software development. But since we are still beginners and have no experience in real-world application development, this is all that we could do.

As time passess by, we realize bit by bit, "Why was this coded this way? Why didn't we use this? and etc."

I hope ya'll folks understand.

It's my first time uploading a project.

I hope it helps anyone out there that needs references!
